/**
 * The
 * <code>Information</code> interface provides all needed methods to obtain
 * information values. Each media source is assigned to an object of this
 * interface which contains a set of information values, such as volume, gain or
 * pan, that describes the media source passing through the various codecs. The
 * kind of information values are codec specific. <br> A value may be another
 * <code>Information</code> object containing tag informations. With the
 * <code>toString</code> method it is possible to get an overview of all loaded
 * hashkeys together with their values. The hashkey is always a
 * <code>String</code> and describes the type and name of the value object. The
 * prefix is the type of the object and the postfix the object name.
 *
 * <p>
 * An example is: "String audioTrackFormat".<br>
 * "String" is the contraction of "java.lang.String".
 *
 * <p> Another example: "java.awt.Dimension dimension".<br>
 * Only "java.lang.." is abbreviated to the pure
 * <code>Class</code> or
 * <code>Interface</code> name.
 *
 * If the type is an int array the prefix is "int[]". This is the general way to
 * label arrays.
 *
 * <p>
 * An example for accessing tag related informations: <p>
 *
 * <code>
 * Information tag;<br>
 * tag = (Information) player.getInformation().get("org.ljmf.Information
 * tag");<br>
 * System.out.println(tag.get("String artist")+" - "+tag.get("String title"));
 * </code>
 *
 * <p>
 * In this example the output device would then print out: "Madonna - Dont Tell
 * Me".
 *
 * <p>
 * These tag related informations may also be of type
 * <code>Information</code>, so that
 * <code>Information</code> objects can build a tree structure.
 * <p>
 * The difference between a value object contained in a
 * <code>Control</code> object and the same named value object contained in an
 * <code>Information</code> object is like the difference between realization
 * and requirement. <br>
 * The
 * <code>Information</code> and
 * <code>Control</code> classes represent a design based on a derivation of a
 * MVC
 * <nobr>(<b>M</b>odel, <b>V</b>iew and <b>C</b>ontroller)</nobr> pattern. For
 * example a decoder could get the request to downsample an audio signal in the
 * form of a scheduled value. It may then try to process the request and
 * feedbacks the result of the processing as a real value. The scheduled value
 * may be fixed to 9500 HZ, but the decoder could only downsample to the nearest
 * possible value of 8000 HZ. Therefore the real value may then determined by
 * 8000 HZ.

/**
 * The
 * <code>Decoder</code> class is the base class for any audio decoder class of
 * any plug-in. The underlying framework converts audio formats indirectly to
 * each other by means of the following determined and uncompressed transmission
 * format: raw, signed, 16 bit, big-endian, pcm (pulse code modulated = digital)
 * audio. In addition, the sample size in bits of this format is fixed to 16
 * bits. This framework may be further developed to support various pcm
 * transmission formats with or higher sample sizes without having outdated
 * plug-in compatibility problems.
 *
 * <p>
 * The technical term "raw" means, that audio data doesn't contain any header
 * (meta) information bytes describing the audio format.
 *
 * <p>
 * The technical term "sample size in bits" determines the value range of the
 * audio sample values. The higher the sample size, the better is the precision
 * of the audio digitalization (quantization). The value range of the audio
 * sample values can either be positive only (unsigned) or not (signed).
 *
 * <p>
 * The technical term "big-/little-endian" refers to which bytes are most
 * significant in multi-byte audio data types. In big-endian architectures, the
 * leftmost bytes (those with a lower address) are most significant. In
 * little-endian architectures, the rightmost bytes are most significant. For
 * example, consider the number 1025 (2 to the tenth power plus one) stored in a
 * 4-byte integer and represented as big-endian: <br>
 * 00000000 00000000 00000100 00000001
 *
 * <p>
 * <table><tr><td><b>Address</b></td><td><b>Big-Endian</b></td><td><b>Little-Endian</b></td></tr>
 * <tr><td>00<br>01<br>02<br>03</td><td>00000000<br>00000000<br>00000100<br>00000001</td><td>00000001<br>00000100<br>00000000<br>00000000</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p>
 * The same number stored in a 4-byte integer and represented as little-endian
 * would result in: <br>
 * 00000001 00000100 00000000 00000000
 *
 * <p>
 * Many mainframe computers, particularly IBM mainframes, use a big-endian
 * architecture. Most modern computers, including PCs, use the little-endian
 * system. The PowerPC system is big-endian because it can understand both
 * systems. Converting data between the two systems is sometimes referred to as
 * the NUXI problem. Imagine the word UNIX stored in two 2-byte words. In a
 * big-endian systems, it would be stored as UNIX. In a little-endian system, it
 * would be stored as NUXI.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that the example above shows only big- and little-endian byte orders.
 * The bit ordering within each byte can also be big- or little-endian, and some
 * architectures actually use big-endian ordering for bits and little-endian
 * ordering for bytes, or vice versa. The terms big-endian and little-endian are
 * derived from the Lilliputians of Gulliver's Travels, whose major political
 * issue was whether soft-boiled eggs should be opened on the big side or the
 * little side. Likewise, the big-/little-endian computer debate has much more
 * to do with political issues than technological merits.

 * It is recommended to combine several codecs in one plug-in for one media
 * container format. An example is to combine the format codecs Mp1 (audio), Mp2
 * (audio), Mp3 (audio), Mpeg1 (video), Mpeg2 (video), and Mpeg4 (video) in one
 * "Mpeg" plug-in. Also codecs should be reused to work in different plug-ins.
